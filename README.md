# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Project! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a full data lifecycle using the **Medallion Architecture** on SQL Server—from raw ingestion to business-ready insights—designed to showcase expertise in **data engineering**, **SQL development**, and **data analysis**.

---

## 🧱 Architecture: Medallion Model

The data warehouse is structured into **three core layers**:

- 🔸 **Bronze Layer**: Raw ERP & CRM data ingested directly from CSV files.
- ⚪ **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, standardized, and enriched data, integrated across systems.
- ⭐ **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled in a **star schema** to power analytics and reporting.

Each layer is implemented using modular **T-SQL scripts**, allowing for scalability and clarity.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

This project simulates a realistic end-to-end business intelligence pipeline:

### 🏗️ Data Engineering
- Design and build a **data warehouse** with Bronze/Silver/Gold layers.
- Implement **ETL logic** using T-SQL.
- Apply **data quality validation** at multiple stages.
- Model data using **fact** and **dimension** tables (star schema).

### 📊 Data Analysis
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL.
- Generate focused reports on:
  - **Customer segmentation**, behavior, and churn.
  - **Product performance** over time.
  - **Regional and seasonal trends** in sales.

## ✅ Data Quality Focus

To ensure trustworthy data analytics, the following validations were performed:

* ✅ Surrogate key uniqueness in dimension tables
* ✅ Referential integrity across fact/dimension joins
* ✅ Schema consistency, null-checks, and outlier detection
* ✅ Deduplication logic for Silver Layer

---

## 📈 Reporting & Insights

After building the Gold Layer, analytical insights were extracted using SQL, focusing on:

* **Customer Segments**: High vs low spenders, churn patterns, frequency of orders.
* **Product Analytics**: Top-performing categories, sales seasonality, pricing patterns.
* **Sales Trends**: Regional patterns, monthly and yearly growth.

Example queries and visuals can be found in:

* `scripts/reports/report_customers.sql`
* `scripts/reports/report_products.sql`

### ✅ Tips to Finalize:
- Replace placeholder links (LinkedIn/GitHub) with your actual profiles.
- If you create charts or visuals in the future, consider including `.png` images under `/docs/` and linking them in the README.

Let me know if you'd like a version with collapsible sections (`<details>`) or if you're adding Power BI/Tableau exports later.
