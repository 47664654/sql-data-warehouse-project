**Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Project!
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) on SQL Server. It highlights core skills in data engineering, SQL development, and data analysis using real-world business logic.

---

**Architecture: Medallion Model**

The project is organized in three layered stages:

* Bronze Layer: Raw ERP & CRM CSV ingestion
* Silver Layer: Data cleaning, standardization, deduplication
* Gold Layer: Star schema, business KPIs, and analytics-ready views

Each layer is developed with modular, maintainable T-SQL scripts.

---

**Project Objectives**

Data Engineering

* Build a scalable data warehouse using best practices
* Implement ETL logic using pure SQL
* Apply data quality validation across pipeline stages
* Create a star schema with fact and dimension tables

Data Analysis

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL
* Deliver business insights through custom reports
* Analyze customer segmentation, product trends, and sales patterns

---

**Tools & Technologies**

* SQL Server Express: Database engine
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): SQL development + debugging
* CSV Files: Simulated ERP & CRM datasets
* Draw\.io: Architecture & schema diagrams
* Notion: Planning, documentation, and tracking

**Data Quality Checks**

This project integrates SQL-based quality checks to ensure data reliability:

* Unique surrogate keys in dimension tables
* Foreign key constraints and referential integrity
* Null checks, outlier detection, and schema conformity
* Deduplication of customer and product records

---

**Business Reporting**

With the Gold Layer built, we extracted insights directly from SQL:

* Customer Analysis:
  Total spend, recency, frequency, average order value
  Segmenting customers (VIP, Regular, New)
  Age group classification

* Product Performance:
  Sales by category/subcategory
  Top-performing and underperforming SKUs
  Average pricing, variety, seasonal performance

See the `scripts/reports/report_customers.sql` and `report_products.sql` files for full reporting queries.
