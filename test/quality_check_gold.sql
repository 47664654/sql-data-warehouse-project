 Script Name     : Data Quality Checks â€“ Gold Layer
 Purpose         : Validates the structural and relational integrity of the 
                   analytical 'gold' layer views, which are used for reporting 
                   and business decision-making.

 Description     : 
    This script performs critical QA checks to ensure:
        - Surrogate keys in dimension tables are unique and non-duplicated
        - All foreign key relationships in the fact table align with 
          existing dimension table records
        - The data model adheres to referential integrity for reliable analytics

 Usage Notes     : 
    - Run this script after creating or refreshing the gold views
    - If any rows are returned by the checks, investigate and resolve before 
      proceeding with reporting or dashboarding
    - This script is non-destructive (read-only)
