 Script Name     : Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Gold Layer
 Purpose         : Performs advanced EDA on final analytical views in the 'gold' 
                   schema to extract actionable business insights.

 Description     : 
    This script covers multiple types of analyses using the star schema model 
    (fact_sales and dimensions) to uncover trends, anomalies, and performance 
    indicators. The key analyses included are:

        1. Change Over Time: Sales trends by month/year
        2. Cumulative Analysis: Running totals and moving averages
        3. Performance Analysis: Product sales vs average and previous periods
        4. Part-to-Whole: Category-level contribution to total sales
        5. Segmentation: Customer and product grouping based on behavior

    These queries help uncover hidden patterns in sales, customer behavior, 
    and product performance.

 Usage Notes     : 
    - Execute after views in the gold layer are created
    - All queries are read-only and non-destructive
    - Ideal for use in BI dashboards, data storytelling, or as a basis for 
      predictive modeling

 Parameters      : None

 Returns         : Insightful query result sets for data storytelling and 
                   business decisions
