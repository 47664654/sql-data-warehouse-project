 Purpose         : Consolidates key customer metrics for analytical reporting.

 Description     : 
    This view aggregates customer behavior and performance insights by:
        1. Retrieving core transaction and customer data
        2. Calculating aggregated metrics at the customer level:
            - Total orders, sales, quantity, product variety
            - Lifespan of customer (months between first and last order)
        3. Deriving KPIs:
            - Recency (months since last order)
            - Average order value
            - Average monthly spend
        4. Enriching customers with segmentation:
            - Age group classification
            - Customer type (VIP, Regular, New)

 Usage Notes     : 
    - Execute after the Gold Layer is populated
    - Ideal for dashboards, CRM analytics, and customer lifecycle modeling
