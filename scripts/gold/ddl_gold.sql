 Script Name     : Create Gold Views â€“ Star Schema
 Purpose         : Builds final analytical views in the 'gold' schema using
                   curated and enriched data from the 'silver' layer.

 Description     : 
    This script creates business-ready views for dimension and fact tables
    following the star schema model. These views serve as the foundation
    for analytics, dashboards, and reporting.

    Includes:
        - Dimension Views (dim_customers, dim_products) with surrogate keys
        - Fact View (fact_sales) linking to dimensions
        - Data enrichment, cleanup, and surrogate key generation
        - Joins across CRM and ERP sources for completeness

 Usage Notes     : 
    - Execute after all transformations in the silver layer are complete
    - These views are not materialized; they compute results at query time
    - Recommended as the primary interface for BI/reporting tools

 Parameters      : None

 Returns         : Logical views with clean and joined data ready for analysis
